## <span id="design-model">How to Design Your NLP Model</span>

### <span id="define-conf">Define the Model Configuration File</span>

To train a neural network, you only need to define your model architecture and some other settings in a JSON configuration file.

You can make your private folder (e.g.*YOURFOLDER*) in *[PROJECTROOT/model_zoo/](./model_zoo)*, then put your model configuration file in *PROJECTROOT/model_zoo/YOURFOLDER/*. In addition, place your data in *[PROJECTROOT/dataset/](./dataset)*.

Take *[PROJECTROOT/model_zoo/demo/conf.json](./model_zoo/demo/conf.json)* as an example (we make it more suitable for usage explanation so that the model architecture might not be practical), this configuration is used for question answer matching task, which aims to figure out whether the passage can be used as an answer of corresponding quesiton or not. 
The sample data lies in *[PROJECTROOT/dataset/demo/](./dataset/demo/)*.

The architecture of the configuration file is:

- **language**. [optional, default: English] Firstly define language type here, we support English and Chinese now.
- **inputs**. This part defines the input configuration.
    - ***use_cache***. If *use_cache* is true, the toolkit would make cache at the first time so that we can accelerate the training process at the next time.
    - ***dataset_type***. Declare the task type here. Currently, we support classification, regression and so on.
    - ***data_paths***.
        - *train_data_path*. [necessary for training] Data for training.
        - *valid_data_path*. [optional for training] Data for validation. During training, the toolkit would save the model which has the best performance on validation data. If you don't need a validation, just remove this node.
        - *test_data_path*. [necessary for training, test] Data for test. If *valid_data_path* is not defined, the toolkit would save the model which has the best performance on test data.
        - *predict_data_path*. [conditionally necessary for prediction] Data for prediction. When we are predicting, if *predict_data_path* is not declared, the toolkit will predict on *test_data_path* instead.
        - *pre_trained_emb*. [optional for training] Pre-trained embeddings.
    - ***pretrained_emb_type***. [optional, default: glove] Currently, We support glove, word2vec, fasttext.
    - ***pretrained_emb_binary_or_text***. [optional, default: text] We support text and binary.
    - ***involve_all_words_in_pretrained_emb***. [optional, default: false] If true, all the words in the pretrained embedings are added to the embedding matrix.
    - ***add_start_end_for_seq***. [optional, default: true] For sequences in data or target, whether to add start and end tag automatically.
    - ***file_header***. [necesssary for training and test] This part defines the file format of train/valid/test data. For instance, the following configuration means there are 3 columns in the data, and we name the first to third columns as question_text, answer_text and label, respectively.
        ```json
        "file_header": {
          "question_text": 0,
          "answer_text": 1,
          "label": 2
        }
        ```
    - ***predict_file_header***. [conditionally necessary for prediction] This part defines the file format of prediction data. **If the file_header of prediction data is not consistent with file_header of train/valid/test data, we have to define "predict_file_header" for prediction data, otherwise conf[inputs][file_header] is applied to the prediction data by default.** Two file_headers are consistent if the indices of data column involved in conf[inputs][model_inputs]) are consistent.
        ```json
        "predict_file_header": {
          "question_text": 0,
          "answer_text": 1
        },
        ```
    - ***file_with_col_header***. [optional, default: false] If your dataset has column name title, remember to set *file_with_col_header* to True. Otherwise, it may result in program error.
    - ***model_inputs***. The node is used for defining model inputs. In this example, there are two inputs: question and answer.
        ```json
        "model_inputs": {
          "question": [
            "question_text"
          ],
          "answer": [
            "answer_text"
          ]
        }
        ```
    - ***target***. [necessary for training and test] This node defines the target column in the train/valid/test data. The type of target is array because our tookit will support multi-target tasks.
- **outputs**. This node defines the settings of path to save models and logs, as well as cache.
    - ***save_base_dir***. The directory to save models and logs.
    - ***model_name***. The model would be saved as save_base_dir/model_name.
    - ***train_log_name/test_log_name/predict_log_name***. The name of log during training/test/prediction.
    - ***predict_fields***. A list to set up the fields you want to predict, such as prediction and confidence.
    - ***cache_dir***. The directory to save cache.
- **training_params**. We define the optimizer and training hyper parameters here.
    - ***optimizer***. 
        - *name*. We support all the optimizers defined in [torch.optim](http://pytorch.org/docs/0.4.1/optim.html?#module-torch.optim).
        - *params*. The optimizer parameters are exactly the same as the parameters of the initialization function of optimizers in [torch.optim](http://pytorch.org/docs/0.4.1/optim.html?#module-torch.optim).
    - ***use_gpu***. [default: true] Whether to use GPU if there is at least one GPU available. In addition,  all GPUs are used by default if there are multiple GPUs, and you can also specify which GPU to use via setting the *CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES* variable as below.
        ```bash
        # Run on GPU0
        CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py
        # Run on GPU0 and GPU1
        CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python train.py
        # Run on CPU
        CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES= python train.py
        ```
    - ***cpu_num_workers***. [default: -1] Define the number of processes to preprocess the dataset. The number of processes is equal to that of logical cores CPU supports if value is negtive or 0, otherwise it is equal to *cpu_num_workers*.
    - ***batch_size***. Define the batch size here. If there are multiple GPUs, *batch_size* is the batch size of each GPU.
    - ***batch_num_to_show_results***. [necessary for training] During the training process, show the results every batch_num_to_show_results batches.
    - ***max_epoch***. [necessary for training] The maximum number of epochs to train.
    - ***valid_times_per_epoch***. [optional for training, default: 1] Define how many times to conduct validation per epoch. Usually, we conduct validation after each epoch, but for a very large corpus, we'd better validate multiple times in case to miss the best state of our model. The default value is 1.
    - ***tokenizer***. [optional] Define tokenizer here. Currently, we support 'nltk' and 'jieba'. By default, 'nltk' for English and 'jieba' for Chinese.
- **architecture**. Define the model architecture. The node is a list of layers (blocks) in block_zoo to represent a model. The supported layers of this toolkit are given in [block_zoo overview](https://microsoft.github.io/NeuronBlocks). 
    
    - ***Embedding layer***. The first layer of this example (as shown below) defines the embedding layer, which is composed of one type of embedding: "word" (word embedding) and the dimension of "word" are 300.  You need to keep this dimension and the dimension of pre-trained embeddings consistent if you specify pre-trained embeddings in *inputs/data_paths/pre_trained_emb*.
        ```json
        {
            "layer": "Embedding",
            "conf": {
              "word": {
                "cols": ["question_text", "answer_text"],
                "dim": 300
              }
             }
        }
        ```
    - Using layers to design your model. You can choose layers in block_zoo to build your model following the fomat:
        - *layer_id*. Customized name for one model layer.
        - *layer*. The layer name in block_zoo.
        - *conf*. Each layer has their own configs (you can find layer name and corresponding parameters in [block_zoo overview](https://microsoft.github.io/NeuronBlocks)).
        - *inputs*. The layer_id which connect to this layer, the type of inputs must be array, because one layer can have multi-layer inputs.
    This is a BiLSTM layer example: 
        ```json
        {
            "layer_id": "question_1",
            "layer": "BiLSTM",
            "conf": {
              "hidden_dim": 64,
              "dropout": 0
            },
            "inputs": ["question"]
        }
        ```
        To access more about supported layers and their configurations, please go to [block_zoo overview](https://microsoft.github.io/NeuronBlocks). For example, if we want to know the parameters of BiLSTM, we can find that there are a BiLSTM class and a BiLSTMConf class, the parameters of BiLSTM would be given at BiLSTMConf.
- **loss**. [necessary for training and test] Currently, we support all the loss functions offered by [PyTorch loss functions](http://pytorch.org/docs/0.4.1/nn.html#loss-functions). The parameters defined in configuration/loss/conf are exactly the same with the parameters of initialization function of loss functions in [PyTorch loss functions](http://pytorch.org/docs/0.4.1/nn.html#loss-functions). Additionally, we offer more options, such as [Focal Loss](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02002.pdf), please refer to [Loss function overview](https://microsoft.github.io/NeuronBlocks/build/html/losses.html).
        Specially, for classification tasks, we usually add a Linear layer to project the output to dimension of number of classes, if we don't know the #classes, we can use '-1' instead and we would calculate the number of classes from the corpus.
        
- **metrics**. Different tasks have different supported metrics, you can follow the table below to select metrics according specific task.


     Task | Supported Metrics 
     -------- | --------  
     classification     | auc, accuracy, f1, macro_f1, macro_precision, macro_recall, micro_f1, micro_precision, micro_recall, weighted_f1, weighted_precision, weighted_recall     
     sequence_tagging|seq_tag_f1, accuracy
     regression |MSE, RMSE
     mrc | F1, EM
    
    During validation, the toolkit selects the best model according to the first metric.

*Tips: The [optional] and [necessary] mark means corresponding node in the configuration file is optional or necessary for training/test/prediction. If there is no mark, it means the node is necessary all the time. Actually, it would be more convenient to prepare a configuration file that contains all the configurations for training, test and prediction.*


### <span id="chinese-support">Chinese Support</span>

When using Chinese data, *language* in JSON config should be set to 'Chinese'. By default, Chinese uses the jieba tokenizer. For an example, see [Task 7: Chinese Sentiment Analysis](#task-7).

In addition, we also support pre-trained Chinese word vectors. Firstly download word vectors from [Chinese Word Vectors](https://github.com/Embedding/Chinese-Word-Vectors#pre-trained-chinese-word-vectors) and *bunzip* , then place it in a directory  (e.g. *dataset/chinese_word_vectors/*). Finally remember to define *inputs/data_paths/pre_trained_emb* in JSON config.


### <span id="visualize">Visualize Your Model</span>

A model visualizer is provided for visualization and configuration correctness checking, please refer to [Model Visualizer README](./model_visualizer/README.md). An example is as below.

### <span id="task-3">Task 3: Question Natural Language Inference</span>

Natural language inference (NLI) is a task that incorporates much of what is necessary to understand language, such as the ability to leverage world knowledge or perform lexico-syntactic reasoning. Given two sentences, a premise and a hypothesis, an NLI system must determine whether the hypothesis is implied by the premise.

- ***Dataset***

    [The Stanford Question Answering Dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is a question-answering dataset consisting of question-paragraph pairs, where one of the sentences in the paragraph (drawn from Wikipedia) contains the answer to the corresponding question (written by an annotator). 
    [QNLI](https://gluebenchmark.com/tasks) converts this task into sentence pair classification by forming a pair between each question and each sentence in the corresponding context, and filtering out pairs with low lexical overlap between the question and the context sentence. The task is to determine whether the context sentence contains the answer to the question. 

- ***Usage***

    1. Run data downloading script.
    ```bash
    cd PROJECT_ROOT/dataset
    python get_QNLI.py
    ```

     BiLSTM(NeuronBlocks) | 0.798 
     BiLSTM+Attn(NeuronBlocks) | 0.810 
    
    *Tips: the model file and train log file can be found in JOSN config file's outputs/save_base_dir after you finish training.*

### <span id="task-4">Task 4: Sentiment Analysis</span>

Sentiment analysis is aimed to predict the sentiment (positive, negative, etc) of a given sentence/document, which is widely applied to many fields.

- ***Dataset***

    [The Stanford Sentiment Treebank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/) consists of sentences from movie reviews and human annotations of their sentiment. We use the two-way (positive/negative) class split, and use only sentence-level labels.

- ***Usage***

### <span id="task-6">Task 6: Knowledge Distillation for Model Compression</span>

Knowledge Distillation is a common method to compress model in order to improve inference speed. Here are some reference papers:
- [Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531)
- [Model Compression with Multi-Task Knowledge Distillation for Web-scale Question Answering System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09636)

#### <span id="task-6.1">6.1: Compression for Query Binary Classifier</span>
This task is to train a query regression model to learn from a heavy teacher model such as BERT based query classifier model. The training process is to minimize the score difference between the student model output and teacher model output. 
- ***Dataset***
*PROJECT_ROOT/dataset/knowledge_distillation/query_binary_classifier*:
    * *train.tsv* and *valid.tsv*: two columns, namely **Query** and **Score**. 
    **Score** is the output score of a heavy teacher model (BERT base finetune model), which is the soft label to be learned by student model as knowledge. 
    * *test.tsv*: two columns, namely **Query** and **Label**. 
    **Label** is a binary value which 0 means negative and 1 means positive.     

        In the meanwhile, you can also replace with your own dataset for compression task trainning.

- ***Usage***

    1. Train student model
    ```bash
    cd PROJECT_ROOT
    python train.py --conf_path=model_zoo/nlp_tasks/knowledge_distillation/query_binary_classifier_compression/conf_kdqbc_bilstmattn_cnn.json
    ```
    
    2. Test student model
    ```bash
    cd PROJECT_ROOT
    python test.py --conf_path=model_zoo/nlp_tasks/knowledge_distillation/query_binary_classifier_compression/conf_kdqbc_bilstmattn_cnn.json
    ```
    
    3. Calculate AUC metric
    ```bash
    cd PROJECT_ROOT
    python tools/calculate_AUC.py --input_file models/kdqbc_bilstmattn_cnn/train/predict.tsv --predict_index 2 --label_index 1 
    ```

#### <span id="task-6.2">6.2: Compression for Text Matching Model</span>
This task is to train a query-passage regression model to learn from a heavy teacher model such as BERT based query-passage matching classifier model. The training process is to minimize the score difference between the student model output and teacher model output.
- ***Dataset***
*PROJECT_ROOT/dataset/knowledge_distillation/text_matching_data*:
    * *train.tsv* and *valid.tsv*: three columns, namely **Query**, **Passage** and **Score**.
    **Score** is the output score of a heavy teacher model (BERT base finetune model), which is the soft label to be learned by student model as knowledge. 
    * *test.tsv*: three columns, namely **Query**, **Passage** and **Label**. 
    **Label** is a binary value which 0 means negative and 1 means positive.     

        In the meanwhile, you can also replace with your own dataset for compression task trainning.

- ***Usage***

    1. Train student model
    ```bash
    cd PROJECT_ROOT
    python train.py --conf_path=model_zoo/nlp_tasks/knowledge_distillation/text_matching_model_compression/conf_kdtm_match_linearAttn.json
    ```
    
    2. Test student model
    ```bash
    cd PROJECT_ROOT
    python test.py --conf_path=model_zoo/nlp_tasks/knowledge_distillation/text_matching_model_compression/conf_kdtm_match_linearAttn.json
    ```
    
    3. Calculate AUC metric
    ```bash
    cd PROJECT_ROOT
    python tools/calculate_AUC.py --input_file=models/kdtm_match_linearAttn/predict.tsv --predict_index=3 --label_index=2 
    ```
    
     *Tips: you can try different models by running different JSON config files.*
- ***Result***

    The AUC of student model is close to that of teacher model and its inference speed is multi-x times faster. 
    
    |Model|AUC|
    |-----|---|
    |Teacher (BERT large)|0.9284|
    |Student-BiLSTM+matchAttn (NeuronBlocks)|0.8817|
    
    *NOTE: the result is achieved with 1200w data, we can only give sample data for demo, you can replace the data with your own data.*

## <span id="advanced-usage">Advanced Usage</span>

After building a model, the next goal is to train a model with good performance. It depends on a highly expressive model and tricks of the model training. NeuronBlocks provides some tricks of model training.

Take *[PROJECTROOT/model_zoo/advanced/conf.json](./model_zoo/advanced/conf.json)* as an example (we make it more suitable for the usage explanation so that the model architecture might not be practical) to introduce the advanced usage, the configuration is used for question answer matching task. 
The sample data lies in *[PROJECTROOT/dataset/advanced_demo](./dataset/advanced_demo)*.

### <span id="extra-feature">Extra Feature Support</span>

Providing more features (postag, NER, char-level feature, etc) to the model than just a single original text may bring more improvements in performance. NeuronBlocks supports multi-feature input and embedding.

To achieve it, you need:

  1. Specify the corresponding column name in config file's inputs/file_header (*char-level feature doesn't need to be specified*).
  ```bash
      "file_header": {
          "question_text": 0,
          "answer_text": 1,
          "label":   2,
          "question_postag": 3,
          "answer_postag": 4
        }
  ```
  2. Specify the corresponding feature name in config file's inputs/model_inputs.
  ```bash
      "model_inputs": {
          "question": ["question_text","question_postag","question_char"],
          "answer": ["answer_text","answer_postag","answer_char"]
        }
  ```
  3. Set the corresponding feature embedding in config file's architecture Embedding layer.
  ```bash
      {
            "layer": "Embedding",
            "conf": {
              "word": {
                "cols": ["question_text", "answer_text"],
                "dim": 300,
                "fix_weight": true
              },
              "postag": {
                "cols": ["question_postag","answer_postag"],
                "dim": 20
              },
              "char": {
                "cols": ["question_char", "answer_char"],
                "type": "CNNCharEmbedding",
                "dropout": 0.2,
                "dim": 30,
                "embedding_matrix_dim": 8,
                "stride":1,
                "window_size": 5,
                "activation": null
              }
            }
        }
  ```
### <span id="lr-decay">Learning Rate Decay</span>

The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters to tune during training. Choosing suitable learning rate is challenging. A too small value may result in a long training process that could get stuck, while a too large value may result in learning a sub-optimal set of weights too fast or an unstable training process.

When training a model, it is often recommended to lower the learning rate as the training progresses. NeuronBlocks provides the function for supporting learning rate decay by setting several parameters in config files.

***training_params/lr_decay***. [float, optional for training, default: 1.0] lr_decay is a float number between 0 and 1, and learning rate will multiply by it at each epoch after *epoch_start_lr_decay*.

***training_params/minimum_lr***. [float, optional for training, default: 0.0] The minimum learning rate during training. Once less than it, the learning rate will be replaced by *minimum_lr*.

***training_params/epoch_start_lr_decay***. [int, optional for training, default: 1] The epoch number of starting learning rate decay.

An example of learning rate decay:
```bash
"optimizer": {
  "name": "Adam",
  "params": {
    "lr": 0.001
  }
},
"lr_decay": 0.95,
"minimum_lr": 0.0001,
"epoch_start_lr_decay": 1
```

### <span id="fix-embedding">Fix Embedding Weight & Limit Vocabulary Size</span>

When corpus is very large, the vocabulary size will become large correspondingly. Moreover the training process will be slow if the vocabulary embedding vectors keep updating during training. 

To solve the above problems, NeuronBlocks supports *fixing embedding weight* (embedding vectors don't update during training) and *limiting vocabulary size*.

- **Fix embedding weight**
    
    ***fix_weight***. [bool, optional for training, default: false] By setting *fix_weight* parameter in architecture/Embedding layer, you can control the embeding vectors is updatable or not during training.
    
    For example, set word embedding not updatable:
    ```bash
    {
      "layer": "Embedding",
      "conf": {
        "word": {
          "cols": ["question_text", "answer_text"],
          "dim": 300,
          "fix_weight": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
- **Limit vocabulary size**
    
    ***training_params/vocabulary/min_word_frequency***. [int, optional for training, default: 3] The word will be removed from corpus vocabulary if its statistical frequency is less than *min_word_frequency*.
    
    ***training_params/vocabulary/max_vocabulary***. [int, optional for training, default: 800,000] The max size of corpus vocabulary. If corpus vocabulary size is larger than *max_vocabulary*, it will be cut according to word frequency.
