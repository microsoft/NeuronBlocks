He O
said O
further O

it O

the O
European B-ORG

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O

was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O

move O
to O
protect O

. O

Fischler S-PER
proposed O

standing O

questioned O

Up O

100,000 O

confounding O
the O

Around O
40,000 O

of O
the O

have O
already O
been O
moved O
to O

Just O
who O

the O

is O
a O
question O
that O
has O
kept O

guessing O
since O
the O

It O
was O
unclear O
whether O

not O
the O

cleared O

which O
would O

negotiate O
concessions O
on O
duties O
-- O
three O
percent O
import O
tax O
and O
17 O
percent O

that O
made O

But O
one O

the O

of O
a O
Hong B-LOC

, O
said O
it O
made O
no O
difference O
if O
the O

not O
. O

" O
If O
they O
spend O
all O

it O

surrounded O
the O

unsure O
not O

of O

what O
its O

Trading O

generally O
agreed O
it O
would O
be O
cost-effective O
to O
take O
the O
copper O
back O
into O
a O

it O

Traders O
in O

CNIEC S-ORG
could O
well O
have O
lent O
it O
to O
the O

at O
around O

a O

when O
it O
started O
taking O

one O
at O
Mont-sur-Marchienne S-LOC

both O

of O
the O

city O
of O
Charleroi S-LOC

Both O
houses O
are O
owned O
by O
Dutroux S-PER

Belgian S-MISC
media O
speculated O
that O
Dutroux S-PER

charged O
with O
abduction O
and O
illegal O
imprisonment O
of O
children O
, O
must O
have O
had O
high O

They O
put O
forward O
no O
proof O
to O

the O
speculation O
, O
but O
seized O
on O
a O
comment O
by O
chief O
prosecutor O
Michel B-PER
Bourlet E-PER
on O
Belgian S-MISC
television O
on O
Friday O
night O
that O
he O
would O
chase O

the O

" O
. O

Bourlet S-PER
said O
between O
300 O
and O
400 O
paedophile O
porn O
video O
tapes O
had O
been O
seized O
, O
some O
of O
which O
featured O
Dutroux S-PER
. O

Dutroux S-PER
was O
charged O
a O
week O
ago O
after O
police O
rescued O
two O
young O
girls O
from O
a O
concrete O
dungeon O
in O
the O
basement O
of O
one O
of O
the O

around O

Just O
a O
day O
later O
the O
national O
euphoria O
at O
the O
rescue O
turned O
to O
disgust O
as O
Dutroux S-PER
led O
police O
to O
the O
bodies O
of O
two O
eight-year-old O
girls O
in O
another O
of O
his O
houses O
. O

Julie B-PER
Lejeune E-PER
and O
Melissa B-PER
Russo E-PER
, O
had O
been O
kidnapped O
in O
June O
last O
year O
. O

Dutroux S-PER
said O
they O
starved O
to O
death O
nine O
months O
later O
. O

He O
also O
admitted O
kidnapping O
two O
other O
girls O
, O
An B-PER
Marchal E-PER
and O
Eefje B-PER
Lambrecks E-PER
, O
a O
year O

. O

The O
fate O
of O
the O
girls O
is O
unknown O
, O
but O
there O
has O
been O
speculation O
they O
were O
sold O
into O
prostitution O
in O
Slovakia S-LOC

the O
Czech B-LOC
Republic E-LOC
where O
Dutroux S-PER

including O
Dutroux S-PER

second O

charged O
as O

The O
others O
have O
been O
charged O
with O
abduction O
and O
illegal O
imprisonment O
of O
children O
or O
are O
suspected O
of O
criminal O
association O

Dutch S-MISC

are O
also O
holding O
a O
74-year O
old O
Dutchman S-MISC
in O
connection O
with O
the O
disappearance O
of O
An S-PER
and O
Eefje S-PER
, O
although O
a O
spokesman O
said O
no O
direct O
link O
had O
yet O
been O
established O
. O

At O
least O
part O
of O
the O
speculation O
in O
the O
Belgian S-MISC
media O
of O
high-level O
protection O
for O
Dutroux S-PER
and O
his O
accomplices O
is O
based O
on O
leaked O
documents O
cataloguing O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
police O
bungling O
, O
incompetence O
and O
indifference O
. O

Among O
the O
revelations O
are O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
gendarmerie O
was O
running O
a O
surveillance O
operation O
codenamed O
" O
Othello S-MISC
" O
against O
Dutroux S-PER
in O
1995 O
-- O
when O
both O
Julie S-PER
and O
Melissa S-PER
and O
An S-PER
and O
Eefje S-PER
were O
kidnapped O
. O

They O
show O
that O
the O
gendarmes O
were O
aware O
that O
Dutroux S-PER
was O
building O
cells O
in O
some O
of O
his O
houses O
for O
holding O
children O
, O
yet O
this O
information O
was O
either O
not O
passed O
on O
to O
other O

forces O
searching O
for O
the O
missing O
girls O
or O
was O
overlooked O
when O
it O
was O
. O

They O
also O
show O
that O
police O
investigating O
a O
theft O
visited O
Dutroux S-PER
late O
last O
year O
at O
the O
house O
where O
Julie S-PER
and O
Melissa S-PER
were O
being O
held O
but O
accepted O
his O
word O
that O
the O
children O
's O
cries O
they O
could O
hear O
came O
from O
neighbours O
. O

Justice S-ORG

There O

his O
controversial O
omission O
from O
the O

A O

disciplinary O

after O

only O
35 O

attempting O

where O

the O
ball O

hit O

said O
the O

last O

were O
not O
intended O
as O
a O

and O
that O
those O
who O

would O
testify O
only O
before O
a O

arm O
of O
the O

" O
I O
do O

, O
" O
he O
said O

" O

That O
was O
not O
the O

are O
expected O
to O
open O
their O
hearts O

to O
tell O

" O

The O
commission O
, O
which O
has O
the O
power O
to O
grant O
amnesty O
to O
those O
who O
confess O
to O
abuses O
, O
has O
begun O
hearing O
the O
testimony O
from O
people O
already O
in O

for O
their O

But O
others O
, O
such O
as O
self-confessed O
secret O

Dirk B-PER
Coetzee E-PER
, O
have O

. O

Tutu S-PER

deputy O

, O
Alex B-PER
Boraine E-PER
, O
told O
reporters O
the O
commission O
would O
begin O
issuing O
subpoenas O
to O
suspects O
who O
refused O
to O
appear O
voluntarily O
some O
time O
this O
week O
. O

He O
added O
that O
former O
hardline O
apartheid O
president O
P.W. B-PER
Botha E-PER
could O
be O
among O
those O
called O
. O

But O
Currin S-PER
, O
who O
is O
advising O
several O
people O
regarded O
as O
perpetrators O
, O
said O
this O
was O
not O
the O
best O
way O

achieve O
the O
commission O

aims O
. O

" O
A O
person O
can O
be O
forced O
to O
appear O
, O
but O
the O
only O
way O
one O
is O
going O
to O
get O
to O
the O
truth O
in O
its O
totality O
is O
if O
people O
feel O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
go O
to O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O
" O

He O
cited O
Coetzee S-PER
, O
who O
was O
charged O
with O
murder O
after O
confessing O
in O

interviews O
to O
dirty O
tricks O
. O

His O
trial O
is O
due O
to O
start O
in O
December O
but O
the O
truth O
commission O
intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin S-PER
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O
so O
all O
judicial O
prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O

left O
many O
South B-MISC

Boraine S-PER
said O
the O
picture O
was O
incomplete O
because O
officers O
of O
the O
apartheid-era O
security O
forces O
had O
yet O
to O
make O
their O
scheduled O
, O
separate O

, O
but O
one O
black O
caller O
to O
a O
radio O

declared O
: O

" O
This O
whole O

is O
utterly O
useless O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
us O
at O
all O
. O

What O
the O

expect O
is O
to O
have O
houses O
, O
to O
have O
jobs O
. O
" O

Political O
scientist O
Jannie B-PER
Gagiano E-PER
said O
he O
doubted O
that O
the O
National B-ORG

, O
which O
implemented O
apartheid O
in O
1948 O
and O
began O
dismantling O
it O
in O

, O
felt O
it O
carried O
a O
burden O
of O
guilt O
and O
needed O
to O
be O
exculpated O
through O
the O
commission O
. O

" O
Therefore O
I O
have O
some O
doubts O
about O
achieving O
some O
form O
of O
reconciliation O

One O
has O
to O

" O
I O

we O

out O

a O

At O
a O
news O

by O
approximately O
50 O
players O
on O

, O
U.S. S-LOC
Davis B-MISC

player O
Todd B-PER
Martin E-PER
expressed O
the O

' O
outrage O
at O
the O
seedings O
. O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. B-MISC
Open E-MISC
has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O
the O
ranking O
system O
, O
has O
tarnished O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
this O
U.S. B-MISC
Open E-MISC
in O
the O
players O
' O
mind O
, O
and O
we O
think O
that O
is O
damaging O
to O
our O
sport O
, O
" O
Martin S-PER
said O
. O

Stich S-PER
said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O
ought O
to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA S-ORG
. O

They O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
, O
" O
said O
Stich S-PER
. O
" O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O
, O
not O
show O
up O
today O
and O
start O
the O
tournament O
tomorrow O
. O
" O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich S-PER
got O
on O
the O
court O
, O
he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O
to O
win O
the O
year O
's O
last O
Grand B-MISC

. O

He O
took O
a O
positive O
first O

with O
his O
6-3 O

Bruguera E-PER
of O

, O
who O
will O
be O
Stich S-PER
's O
next O
opponent O
. O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich S-PER
's O
mind O
that O
U.S. B-MISC
Open E-MISC
officials O
did O
tamper O
with O
the O
seeding O
process O
in O
order O
to O
benefit O
homegrown O
players O
. O

" O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
here O
for O
the O
American S-MISC
players O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
all O
the O
other O
players O
, O
" O
said O
Stich S-PER
, O
who O
lost O
the O
1994 O
Open S-MISC
final O
to O
Andre B-PER
Agassi E-PER
. O

It O
was O
Agassi S-PER
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O
draw O
was O
completed O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

The O
flamboyant O
American S-MISC
star O
was O
bumped O
up O
two O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP S-ORG
ranking O
of O
eight O
to O
a O
seeding O
of O
six O
. O

" O
He O
( O
Agassi S-PER
) O
should O
be O
seeded O
the O
way O
he O
is O
playing O
tennis O
right O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Stich S-PER
about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O
Agassi S-PER
, O
who O
made O
early O
exits O
from O
the O
French B-MISC
Open E-MISC
and O
Wimbledon S-MISC
. O

Stich S-PER
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O
, O
might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O
the O
seedings O
himself O
after O
Kafelnikov S-PER
withdrew O
. O

Ranked O
18th O
in O
the O
world O
, O
Stich S-PER
might O
have O
been O
slipped O
into O
that O
spot O
ahead O
of O
Spain S-LOC
's O
Felix B-PER
Mantilla E-PER
, O
who O
is O
16th O
but O
had O
never O
been O
played O
in O
the O
Open S-MISC
and O
had O
been O
left O
out O
of O
the O
seedings O
originally O
. O

But O
Stich S-PER
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
that O
game O
. O

" O
I O
think O
he O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
as O
everybody O
else O
who O
is O
in O

top O
16 O

playing O
for O
a O

and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-PER
Maskhadov E-PER
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin S-PER

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O

it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed S-PER
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow S-LOC

Lebed S-PER
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow S-LOC

who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O

want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov S-PER
warned O
that O
Lebed S-PER
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian S-MISC
army O
commander O
in O
the O

who O
sought O
a O
compromise O

was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens S-MISC
say O
-- O
Russian S-MISC
forces O
. O

Maskhadov S-PER
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed S-PER
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin S-LOC
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin S-PER
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya S-LOC
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian B-LOC
Federation E-LOC
-- O
something O
Moscow S-LOC
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North B-LOC
Caucasus E-LOC
. O

Lebed S-PER
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O

" O

For O
Medvedev S-PER
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O
and O
not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O
peripheral O

such O
as O
the O
poor O
quality O
of O
food O

lounge O
, O
an O

that O
took O
his O

off O

. O

" O
I O

what O
I O
'm O
here O
for O
, O
" O
said O
Medvedev S-PER
, O
who O
lost O
in O
the O
second O
round O
of O
the O
Open S-MISC
the O
last O
two O
years O
after O
reaching O
the O
quarters O
in O
1993 O
, O
the O
same O
year O
he O
tried O
his O
hand O
as O
a O
restaurant O
critic O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
not O
here O
to O
fight O
the O
press O
or O
talk O
about O
the O
food O
or O
entertain O
the O

I O
have O
much O
more O
fun O
on O
the O
court O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Just O
three O
years O
ago O
Medvedev S-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O
's O
best O
, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French B-MISC
Open E-MISC
semifinal O
and O
winning O
three O
tournaments O
. O

But O
Medvedev S-PER
's O
ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O
year O
as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O
injury O
. O

The O
Ukrainian S-MISC
finally O
hit O
a O
low O
of O
44th O
two O
months O
ago O
. O

" O
It O
's O
somewhere O
where O
I O
would O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
, O
" O
Medvedev S-PER
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
36 O
. O
" O

It O
's O
a O
part O
of O
the O
penalty O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
" O

As O
part O
of O
his O
new O
businesslike O
approach O
, O
Medvedev S-PER
hired O
Australian S-MISC
coach O
Bob B-PER
Brett E-PER
at O
the O
start O
of O
this O
year O
and O
the O
partnership O
is O
beginning O
to O
pay O
off O
. O

" O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
we O
started O
from O
zero O
, O
" O
said O
Medvedev S-PER
. O
" O

Winning O
in O
Long B-LOC
Island E-LOC
( O
last O
week O
) O
was O
like O
winning O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O
" O

While O
Medvedev S-PER
's O
77-minute O
romp O
past O
Fleurian S-PER
was O
rather O
ordinary O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
two O
were O
playing O
each O
other O
was O
rather O
remarkable O
. O

In O
the O
original O
draw O
, O
Medvedev S-PER
and O
Fleurian S-PER
were O
slotted O
to O
play O
each O
other O
. O

When O
controversy O
forced O
the O
draw O
to O
be O
done O
over O
-- O
against O
odds O
of O
151-to-1 O
-- O
Medvedev S-PER
and O
Fleurian S-PER
drew O
each O
other O
a O
second O
time O
. O

" O
When O
I O
saw O
the O
new O
draw O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
change O
my O
preparation O
, O
" O
Medvedev S-PER
said O
. O
" O

I O
think O
it O
's O
destined O
that O
it O
turned O
out O
for O
me O

The O
European B-ORG
Commission E-ORG
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
would O
study O
scientific O
reports O
saying O
Britain S-LOC
's O
mad O
cow O
epidemic O
would O
die O
out O
by O
2001 O
but O
offered O
little O
prospect O
the O
findings O
would O
change O
an O
agreed O
slaughter O
campaign O
. O

" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
research O
. O

We O
will O
ask O
the O
( O
EU S-ORG
) O
scientific O
and O
veterinary O
committee O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
" O
Commission S-ORG
spokesman O
Gerard B-PER
Kiely E-PER
told O
Reuters S-ORG
. O

But O
he O
added O
that O
new O
research O
into O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
( O
BSE S-MISC
) O
, O
a O
fatal O
brain-wasting O
disease O
suffered O
by O
cattle O
, O
was O
unlikely O
to O
alter O
a O
slaughter O
plan O
agreed O
by O
Britain S-LOC
and O
its O
14 O
EU S-ORG
partners O
. O

" O
We O
agreed O
that O
following O
detailed O
scientific O
analysis O
using O
a O
methodology O
which O
would O
take O
out O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
BSE S-MISC
cases O
possible O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O
to O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission E-ORG
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O
of O
fewer O
BSE S-MISC
cases O
, O
" O
Kiely S-PER
said O
. O

" O
We O
will O
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O
to O
the O
plan O
) O
but O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
involved O
with O
the O
number O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O
the O
question O
of O
numbers O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
that O
's O
not O
the O
issue O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O
of O
consumers O
' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE S-MISC
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British S-MISC
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford S-ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature S-ORG
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O
cattle O
. O

The O
researchers O
predicted O
there O
would O
be O
340 O
new O
infections O
and O
14,000 O
new O
cases O
of O
BSE S-MISC
before O
2001 O
. O

British S-MISC
farmers O
' O
leader O
called O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
an O
urgent O
meeting O
with O
ministers O
to O
discuss O
the O
report O
. O

" O
I O
hope O
the O
government O
will O
now O
make O
it O
clear O
they O
believe O
there O
is O
a O
better O
way O
of O
dealing O
with O
this O
issue O
, O
" O
National B-ORG
Farmers I-ORG
Union E-ORG
president O
Sir O
David B-PER
Naish E-PER
told O
BBC B-ORG
radio E-ORG
. O

Naish S-PER
said O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
Britain S-LOC
to O
carry O
out O
a O
planned O
cull O
of O
some O
147,000 O
cattle O
to O
which O
it O
had O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
placate O
its O
European S-MISC
partners O
. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O
animals O
being O
culled O
if O
in O
fact O
scientists O
throughout O
Europe S-LOC
accepted O
this O
evidence O
, O
" O
Naish S-PER
said O
. O

The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O
a O
damaging O
row O
between O
Britain S-LOC
and O
the O
EU S-ORG
, O
which O
slapped O
a O
worldwide O
ban O
on O
British S-MISC
beef O
after O
the O
government O
said O
there O
could O
be O
a O
link O
between O
BSE S-MISC
and O
the O
human O
form O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

The O
issue O
flared O
in O
in O
March O
when O

scientists O
admitted O
that O
people O
could O
become O
infected O
with O
Creutzfeldt-Jakob B-MISC

optimistic O

he O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
our O
best O
judgment O
at O
this O
stage O
is O
that O
it O
will O
probably O
bumble O
along O

the O
rather O

way O
it O

" O

" O
It O

very O

a O

in O

, O
Hope S-PER

: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O
) O
is O
the O
first O
half O
has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
felt O
it O

equally O
we O
're O
certainly O
not O
predicting O
a O

in O

" O

Against O
this O
background O
, O
Hope S-PER
said O
the O

was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O

destocked O
even O

this O

which O
had O
slipped O
to O
9.5 O
percent O
from O
11.3 O
percent O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
've O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
sold O
the O
( O
southern O
African S-MISC

mines O
actually O
is O
not O
bad O
. O

" O
It O
does O
show O
how O
easily O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
bounce O
back O
over O
10 O
percent O
again O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
We O
continue O
to O
feel O
very O
relaxed O
about O
our O
general O
view O
that O
we O
would O
average O
10 O
percent O
profit O
margins O
over O
the O
cycle O
. O
" O

" O
We O
've O
always O
taken O
the O
view O
that O
we O
are O
the O
sort O
of O
company O
that O
's O
quite O
capable O
of O
working O
in O
difficult O

we O

we O

that O
we O

Hope S-PER

" O
When O
the O

a O
hot O
topic O
on O

this O

Concern O
centred O
on O

tour O

been O
his O
unflagging O

" O

" O

Fear O
that O
a O
new O

might O
favour O
a O
return O

policy O
could O
spell O

As O
for O
U.S. B-ORG
Treasury E-ORG
securities O
, O
Widness S-PER
explained O
that O
Alan B-PER
Greenspan E-PER

reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Reserve E-ORG
and O
the O
outlook O

were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin S-PER
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury S-ORG
. O

" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O

to O
the O
United B-LOC

, O
" O
said O
Widness S-PER
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. S-LOC
stocks O

, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin S-PER
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury S-ORG
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O

convincing O

that O
